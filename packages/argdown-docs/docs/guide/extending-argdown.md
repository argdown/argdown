# Extending Argdown

This guide will teach you how to write your own Argdown plugin, how to load it using a config file, and how to integrate Argdown in your own application. While it is easy to do so, you need to have some experience with Javascript or at least another programming language to follow along.

Additional information on the core classes and interfaces of the Argdown parser can be found in the [API documentation](/api/).
