## @argdown/core v0.8.5 (2018-05-28)

## @argdown/core v0.8.4 (2018-05-24)

- added has-line class to all html elements with line numbers.

## @argdown/core v0.8.3 (2018-05-16)

### Minor changes

- Parser: Added startLine information for block elements (statements, arguments, relations, list items).
- HTML export: Added data-line attributes for block elements. This will make it possible to sync scrolling in VS Code preview.
- HTML export: added configuration options (will be used in VS Code preview) to change validateLink and normalizeLink behaviour.

### Bug fixes

- Fixed line numbers for relations, argument statements, inferences and list items. The lexer now puts all single line breaks in a special group, instead of skipping them completely. This makes it possible to ignore single line breaks in the parser, but still check the lexing context for line breaks.

## @argdown/core v0.8.2 (2018-05-15)

### Minor changes

- Improved security of HTML Export: link validation
- Added utils for link validation/normalization (copied from Markdown-It)

## @argdown/core v0.8.1 (2018-04-10)

### Minor changes

- Plugins can now use the prepare method to add default settings to the request object before argdownListeners and the run method are called. Plugins no longer have to keep any kind of state (see Readme for details).

### Bug fixes

- Windows line endings in argument reconstructions and list items no longer produce lexer errors.

## @argdown/core v0.8.0 (2018-03-22)

### Breaking Changes

- changed application and plugin structure: app.run(request) expects a request object with an input field, a process array, containing the processors to be run, and configuration options. Plugins now get passed a request and a response object and are expected to add their data to the response and return it.

## @argdown/core v0.7.2 (2018-02-21)

The plugin can now be found at [argdown-png-export](https://github.com/christianvoigt/argdown-png-export) and can be added to argdown-cli using the new features of argdown.config.js

## @argdown/cli v0.9.0
