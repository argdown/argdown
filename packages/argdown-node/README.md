This package consists of classes specific for running Argdown applications in Node.js:

- The package contains the AsynArgdownApplication subclass supporting asynchronous plugin methods.
- It instantiates this class with all plugins and processes preconfigured and predefined so that you can use it directly without any additional setup.
- It provides plugins that are specific to Argdown applications that are running in Node.js and not in the browser, for example the LoadFilePlugin and the SaveAsPlugin.

The package is used in @argdown/cli and @argdown/vscode.

This package is part of the [Argdown project](https://argdown.org).
