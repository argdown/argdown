[Argdown](https://argdown.org) is a simple syntax for analyzing complex argumentation.

- Listing pros & cons in Argdown is as simple as writing a twitter message. You don't have to learn anything new, except a few simple rules that will feel very natural.
- With these simple rules you will be able to define more complex relations between arguments or dive into the details of their logical premise-conclusion structures.
- Argdown can even be used within Markdown! Your code is transformed into an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_map">argument map</a> while you are typing. When your are ready, you can publish your analysis as pdf, embed it as a web-component in a webpage or simply export your map as an image.

Start with [the docs](https://argdown.org) or try it out in the [Browser Sandbox](https://argdown.org/sandbox).

If you want to start working right away, you should install the [Argdown VS Code extension](https://argdown.org/guide/installing-the-vscode-extension).
